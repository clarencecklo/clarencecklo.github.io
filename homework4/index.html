        <h1>Reliable</h1><br />
        <p>it means that when the app is launched, the PWA will load instantly, regardless of the network state – we
previously saw the using of Service Workers, written in JavaScript that will pre-cache key resources of the application
thus eliminating the dependence on the network and making sure that the user will have an instant and reliable
experience.</p>


        <h1>Fast</h1><br />
        <p>according to some studies, 53% of users will abandon a site that takes longer than 3 seconds to load! And even
when the application/site is loaded, the users expect them to be fast with no slow-to-respond interfaces.
</p>


        <h1>Engaging</h1><br />
        <p>users are able to install PWA’s and those will live on the user’s home screen without the need for any
type of app store. These applications offer a very rich experience with the help from a web app manifest file and can
re-engage users with web push notifications. The manifest file allows you to control how your app appears and how
it’s launched (home screen icons to be shown, the page to load when the app is launched, the screen orientation,
etc.).</p>
